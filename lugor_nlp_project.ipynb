    "## The Plan\n",
    " ### Acquisition Phase:\n",
    "- The project commences with the acquisition of README files from a variety of repositories. Alongside these files, we also gather metadata about the repositories, which includes the primary programming language used. Our dataset included 960 repositories. We used GitHub's <a href='https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E0&s=stars&type=Repositories'>the most starred repositories</a>. Generated the list of repositories programmatically using web scraping techniques.\n",
    " ### Preparation Phase:\n",
    "- Following acquisition, we move into the preparation phase. Here, the README text data underwent preprocessing, which encompasses cleaning, normalization, lemmatized, tokenization and removing stopwords. Simultaneously, the target variable, which is the primary programming language. Since the pages linked above change over time, note: \"Our data comes from the top 960 most starred repositories on GitHub as of 27 June 2023\".\n",
    " ### Exploration Phase:\n",
    "- Next, we enter the exploration phase. This involves conducting an exploratory data analysis on the README texts. The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and potential relationships between the text and the programming language used in the repository. Here we explorated the following ideas:\n",
    "> What are the most common words in READMEs?\n",
    "> Does the length of the README vary by programming language?\n",
    "> Do different programming languages use a different number of unique words?\n",
    "> Are there any words that uniquely identify a programming language?\n",
    " ### Modeling Phase:\n",
    "- The final phase is modeling. The data is divided into training, validate and testing sets. Transform our content into a format suitable for a machine learning model. Try fitting several different models and using several different representations of the text (e.g., a simple bag of words, then also the TF-IDF values for each). Build a function that took in the text of a README file and attempted to predict the programming language. We used the top 3 languages (JavaScript, Objective-C, Java) and then label everything else as \"Other\" so that you have fewer unique values to predict. Each model's performance is evaluated on the testing set using appropriate metrics. The model that performs the best is then optimized and validated on unseen data."

    "Predicting the primary programming language of a repository from its README file is a challenging task, as the README file typically contains descriptive information about the project rather than code. However, there are several strategies that could be employed:\n",

    "Keyword Analysis: Certain keywords might be more prevalent in README files of projects that use specific programming languages.

Various machine learning models could be trained on this task, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or even neural networks.\n",

    "Remember, the accuracy of the predictions will heavily depend on the quality and quantity of the training data. The more diverse and representative the training data is, the better the model will likely perform."

    "  b. Save it in your env.py file under the variable `github_token`      \n",
    "  c. Add your github username to your env.py file under the variable `github_username`       \n",
    "  d. Add more repositories to the `REPOS` list below.     \n",
